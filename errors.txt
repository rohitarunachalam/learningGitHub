Bad1.java's error was a compile time error since program was named Bad1 and the
class was named BAD1 which isn't the same because java is case sensitive.

Bad2.java's error was a runtime error since Line 6 attempts to divide by zero
which is illegal, but syntactically correct.

Bad3.java's error was a compile time error, because it attempted to initialize a
string by assigning it a char value which is illegal.
